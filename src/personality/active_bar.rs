//! Process-wide bar/tracing coordination via a singleton `MultiProgress`.
//!
//! Indicatif redraws progress bars by emitting ANSI cursor escapes that
//! assume nothing else has written to the terminal between draws. Tracing
//! writes to stderr break that assumption: a WARN/ERROR event lands mid-
//! redraw and the bar's lines duplicate or get partially overwritten.
//!
//! `MultiProgress` provides `suspend(f)` which clears the bars, runs `f`
//! (where stderr writes happen), and redraws. We register every bar with the
//! singleton and wrap stderr writes in `with_suspended` so tracing events
//! cleanly print above an intact bar.
