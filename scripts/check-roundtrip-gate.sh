# Heuristic diff guard for serializer changes in src/.

# Fail when this branch adds/changes a serializer without a corresponding
# round-trip test edit. Catches `parse(serialize(x))`-shape bugs that pass
# per-side review by demanding the property test exist.
#
# This is intentionally heuristic. It can false-positive on serializer-looking
# helper functions that have no inverse, and it can false-negative when a
# serializer changes without adding a new matching line. Treat a failure as a
# review prompt, not proof that the code is wrong.
#
# Triggers on added lines (`^+`, not `^+++`) matching any of:
#   fn to_raw / fn to_string / fn serialize / fn to_toml / fn to_json
#   impl <...> Serialize for

# Looks for a corresponding signal in test diffs:
#   roundtrip / round_trip / serialize.*parse / parse.*serialize /
#   to_raw.*from_raw / from_raw.*to_raw

# Override: KEI_SKIP_ROUNDTRIP_GATE=1 (use only with a written reviewer rationale).

roundtrip-gate: heuristic serializer change detected without a round-trip test edit.

Changed serializers (diff vs $MERGE_BASE):
$(printf '%s\n' "$SERIALIZER_HITS" | sed 's/^/  /')

Add a test that exercises \`parse(serialize(x)) == x\` (or equivalent
inverse) for the type whose serializer changed. Look for an existing
\`*_roundtrip\` / \`round_trip\` test in tests/ or src/ as a pattern.

If this serializer truly has no inverse and no round-trip property,
add the test name with a short reviewer rationale explaining why
(\`fn no_roundtrip_*\`) so the gate sees the signal and the next
reviewer sees the rationale.

To bypass for an emergency hotfix: KEI_SKIP_ROUNDTRIP_GATE=1 just gate
