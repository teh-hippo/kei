- Parallel downloads with incremental sync (seconds on large libraries after the first run)
- Resumable transfers verified by size and content hash
- Watch mode, systemd integration, headless 2FA, Docker-ready
- iCloud Photos supported today. NextCloud, Immich, Ente, and Google Takeout next.

> [!CAUTION]
> kei is pre-release software under active development, and minor versions may contain breaking changes. We follow a deprecate-then-remove practice, but always check CHANGELOG when updating.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> v0.13 reshapes selection and folder-structure flags. `--exclude-album NAME` becomes `--album '!NAME'`. `--library` accepts multiple values. `kei sync` with no flags now runs per-album passes plus an unfiled pass. Legacy `{album}` in `--folder-structure` auto-migrates with a warning until v0.20. Full migration guide: [docs/v0.13-migration.md](docs/v0.13-migration.md).
>
> | Flag | Default |
> |---|---|
> | `--album` | `all` |
> | `--smart-folder` | `none` |
> | `--library` | `primary` |
> | `--unfiled` | `true` |
> | `--folder-structure` | `%Y/%m/%d` |
> | `--folder-structure-albums` | `{album}` |
> | `--folder-structure-smart-folders` | `{smart-folder}` |

## Install

```sh
brew install rhoopr/kei/kei             # Homebrew

docker pull ghcr.io/rhoopr/kei:latest   # Docker
# :latest follows tagged releases. Use :main to track main HEAD for unreleased builds.
```

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/rhoopr/kei/releases). For Docker Compose, building from source, FreeBSD, and other install paths, see the [Install wiki page](https://github.com/rhoopr/kei/wiki/Install).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> kei can't access your photos if Advanced Data Protection is on. Turn ADP off and enable "Access iCloud Data on the Web" in your Apple ID settings. Details: [Authentication wiki](https://github.com/rhoopr/kei/wiki/Authentication#advanced-data-protection-adp).

---

## Quick start

```sh
kei sync -u you@example.com -d ~/Photos/iCloud --save-password
```

You'll be prompted for your password, then asked to approve 2FA on a trusted device. Downloads start right after. After the first run, just `kei sync` - username, directory, and password are all remembered.

For a guided walkthrough, run `kei config setup` instead.

> [!TIP]
> Coming from `icloudpd`? The [Migration Guide](docs/migration-from-python.md) shows how to `kei sync` without re-downloading.

---

## Run as a service

Register kei to start at boot and keep syncing in the background. One command per platform:

```sh
kei install --user            # Linux (systemd user unit)
kei install                   # macOS (launchd agent)
kei install                   # Windows (run from elevated PowerShell)
```

Inside Docker the command is a no-op; the container runtime is the supervisor. Keep using `docker compose up -d`.

Verify with `kei status` (the first line reports the service state) or `kei service status` for the platform-tuned view. To remove: `kei uninstall` (add `--purge` to also wipe state, config, and credentials).

Full per-platform guide including troubleshooting: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md). What the service runs once registered: [docs/service.md](docs/service.md).

## Acknowledgments

The iCloud adapter builds on years of reverse-engineering by the [icloud-photos-downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader) project (kei was originally published as `icloudpd-rs` before broadening to a multi-provider sync engine). Thanks to the original maintainers for their work, which made the iCloud side of kei possible.
