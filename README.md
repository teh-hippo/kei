kei copies cloud-hosted photos and videos into folders you control. Today that includes iCloud Photos. The goal is a fast, parallel local backup you can run once, keep as a mirror, or leave unattended in Docker.

It handles the parts that make photo backups annoying: big libraries, shared libraries, albums, Live Photos, RAW files, edited versions, retries, interrupted downloads, and existing archives you don't want to download twice.

> [!WARNING]
> kei is pre-release software. Minor versions may contain breaking changes.
> 
> Read [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) before updating.

## Install

```sh
brew install rhoopr/kei/kei
```

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/rhoopr/kei:latest
```

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/rhoopr/kei/releases). For Docker Compose, source builds, FreeBSD, and NAS setup, see [Install](https://github.com/rhoopr/kei/wiki/Install).

## Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **v0.20 moved durable sync settings into TOML.**
>
> Keep CLI flags for one run, env vars for secrets and service glue, and saved settings in `config.toml`.
>
> If an old command fails with a removed flag such as `--download-dir`, move that value into the config file:
>
> ```toml
> [download]
> directory = "/photos"
> ```
>
> Use the [v0.20 migration guide](docs/v0.20-migration.md) and [example.config.toml](example.config.toml) for the full option-by-option TOML reference, including defaults and valid values.

```sh
kei config setup
kei sync
```

The setup wizard creates `~/.config/kei/config.toml`, asks where photos should land, and can save your password in the OS keyring. You'll still approve 2FA on a trusted Apple device the first time.

A tiny config looks like this:

```toml
[auth]
username = "you@example.com"

[download]
directory = "~/Photos/iCloud"
```

After the first run:

```sh
kei status
kei sync --recent 30d
kei list albums
```

## What kei gives you

- Fast, parallel downloads for large cloud photo libraries.
- A local copy of your media, with no Apple Photos library required.
- Folder layouts for dates, albums, smart folders, shared libraries, and unfiled photos.
- Original photos and videos, plus Live Photos, RAW siblings, and edited versions when you ask for them.
- Resumable downloads and checksum checks before files are marked complete.
- One-shot sync, watch mode, Docker, systemd, launchd, and Windows service support.
- Maintenance commands for status checks, local diagnostics, manifest export, verification, reconcile, reset, and existing-file import.

Today kei syncs iCloud Photos. Immich, Google Takeout, Nextcloud, and Ente support are on the roadmap.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> kei needs iCloud Photos web access. If `Advanced Data Protection` is on, turn it off and enable "Access iCloud Data on the Web" in your Apple ID settings. See [Authentication](https://github.com/rhoopr/kei/wiki/Authentication#advanced-data-protection-adp).

## Product direction

kei is built around reliable local backup: safe file writes, explainable state,
service-friendly operation, and no destructive behavior unless you explicitly
ask for it.

Read the [product charter](docs/product-charter.md) and
[roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for current priorities.

## Common setups

### Keep a daily mirror

```toml
[auth]
username = "you@example.com"

[download]
directory = "/photos"

[watch]
interval = 86400
```

Run it with `kei service run`, Docker Compose, or `kei install`.

### Sync only part of the library

```toml
[filters]
albums = ["Family", "Trips"]
unfiled = false
media = ["photos", "videos", "live-photos"]
```

You can also sync recent media for one run:

```sh
kei sync --recent 100
kei sync --recent 30d
```

### Adopt files you already have

```sh
kei import-existing
kei sync
```

### Refresh metadata after a fix

If a kei upgrade fixes a metadata decode or capture bug, re-apply the corrected
metadata to media you already downloaded, without downloading it again:

```sh
kei sync --refresh-metadata
```
